			<p>You're my everything underneath the sun</p>
			<p>You're my everything rolled up into one</p>
			<p>You're my only dream, my only real reality</p>
			<p>You're my idea of a perfect personality</p>
			<p>You're my everything, everything I need</p>
			<p>You're the song I sing and the book I read</p>
			<p>You're a way beyond belief and just to make it brief</p>
			<p>You're my winter, summer, spring, my everything</p>
			<p>You're my everything (everything I need)</p>
