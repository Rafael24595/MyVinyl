 			<br>
			<p>Living for you is easy living</p>
			<p>It's easy to live when you're in love</p>
			<p>And I'm so in love</p>
			<p>There is nothing in life but you</p>
			<p>I never regret the years that I'm giving</p>
			<p>They're easy to give when you're in love</p>
			<p>I'm happy to do whatever I do for you</p>
			<p>For you maybe I'm a fool</p>
			<p>But it's fun</p>
			<p>People say you rule me with one wave of your hand</p>
			<p>Darling, it's grand</p>
			<p>They just don't understand</p>
			<p>Living for you is easy living</p>
			<p>It's easy to live when you're in love</p>
			<p>And I'm so in love</p>
			<p>There's nothing in life but you</p>
