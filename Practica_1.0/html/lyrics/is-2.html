 			<p class="title1">I Don't Want to Set the World on Fire</p>
 			<br>
 			<p>I don't want to set the world on fire</p>
			<p>I just want to start a flame in your heart</p>
			<p>In my heart I have but one desire</p>
			<p>And that one is you, no other will do</p>
			<p>I've lost all ambition for worldly acclaim</p>
			<p>I just want to be the one you love</p>
			<p>And with your admission that you'd feel the same</p>
			<p>I'll have reached the goal I'm dreaming of, believe me</p>
			<p>I don't want to set the world on fire</p>
			<p>I just want to start a flame in your heart</p>
			<p>I don't want to set the world on fire, honey</p>
			<p>I love you too much</p>
			<p>I just want to start a great big flame down in your heart</p>
			<p>You see, way down deep inside of me, darling</p>
			<p>I have only one desire</p>
			<p>And that one desire is you</p>
			<p>And I know, baby, ain't nobody else gonna do</p>
			<p>I've lost all ambition for worldly acclaim</p>
			<p>I just want to be the one you love</p>
			<p>And with your admission that you'd feel the same</p>
			<p>I'll have reached the goal I'm dreaming of, believe me</p>
			<p>I don't want to set the world on fire</p>
			<p>I just want to start a flame in your heart</p>
