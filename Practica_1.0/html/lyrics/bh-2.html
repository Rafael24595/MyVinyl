 			<p class="title1">Gloomy Sunday</p>
 			<br>
			<p>Sunday is gloomy
			<p>My hours are slumberless</p>
			<p>Dearest the shadows</p>
			<p>I live with are numberless</p>
			<p>Little white flowers</p>
			<p>Will never awaken you</p>
			<p>Not where the black coach</p>
			<p>Of sorrow has taken you</p>
			<p>Angels have no thoughts</p>
			<p>Of ever returning you</p>
			<p>Would they be angry</p>
			<p>If I thought of joining you</p>
			<p>Gloomy Sunday</p>
			<p>Gloomy is Sunday</p>
			<p>With shadows I spend it all</p>
			<p>My heart and I</p>
			<p>Have decided to end it all</p>
			<p>Soon there'll be candles</p>
			<p>And prayers that are said I know</p>
			<p>Let them not weep</p>
			<p>Let them know that I'm glad to go</p>
			<p>Death is no dream</p>
			<p>For in death I'm caressin' you</p>
			<p>With the last breath of my soul</p>
			<p>I'll be blessin' you</p>
			<p>Gloomy Sunday</p>
			<p>Dreaming, I was only dreaming</p>
			<p>I wake and I find you asleep</p>
			<p>In the deep of my heart here</p>
			<p>Darling I hope</p>
			<p>That my dream never haunted you</p>
			<p>My heart is tellin' you</p>
			<p>How much I wanted you</p>
			<p>Gloomy Sunday</p>
