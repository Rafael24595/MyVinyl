 			<br>
 			<p>Some like a night at the movies, some like a dance or a show</p>
			<p>Some are content with an evening spent home by the radio</p>
			<p>Some like to live for the moment, some like to just reminisce</p>
			<p>But whenever I have an evening to spend. just give me one like this</p>
			<p>This is a lovely way to spend an evening. can't think of anything I'd rather do</p>
			<p>This is a lovely way to spend an evening, can't think of anyone as lovely as you</p>
			<p>A casual stroll through a garden. a kiss by a lazy lagoon</p>
			<p>Catching a breath of moonlight, humming our favorite tune</p>
			<p>This is a lovely way to spend an evening</p>
			<p>I want to save all my nights and spend them with you</p>
			<p>Catching a breath of moonlight, humming our favorite tune</p>
			<p>This is a lovely way to spend an evening</p>
			<p>I want to save all my nights and spend them with you</p>
