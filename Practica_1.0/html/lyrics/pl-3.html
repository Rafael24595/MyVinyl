			<p class="title">Peggy Lee</p>
 			<p class="title1">Black Coffee</p>
 			<br>
			<p>I'm feelin' mighty lonesome</p>
			<p>Haven't slept a wink</p>
			<p>I walk the floor and watch the door</p>
			<p>And in between I drink</p>
			<p>Black coffee</p>
			<p>Love's a hand-me-down brew</p>
			<p>I'll never know a Sunday</p>
			<p>In this weekday room</p>
			<p>I'm talkin' to the shadows</p>
			<p>One o'clock 'til four</p>
			<p>And Lord, how slow the moments go</p>
			<p>When all I do is pour</p>
			<p>Black coffee</p>
			<p>Since the blues caught my eye</p>
			<p>I'm hangin' out on Monday</p>
			<p>My Sunday dreams to dry</p>
			<p>Now man was born to go a lovin'</p>
			<p>But was a woman born to weep and fret</p>
			<p>To stay at home and tend her oven</p>
			<p>And down her past regrets</p>
			<p>In coffee and cigarettes</p>
			<p>I'm moonin' all the mornin'</p>
			<p>Moanin' all the night</p>
			<p>And in between it's nicotine</p>
			<p>And not much heart to fight</p>
			<p>Black coffee</p>
			<p>Feelin' low as the ground</p>
			<p>It's drivin' me crazy</p>
			<p>This waitin' for my baby</p>
			<p>To maybe come around</p>
