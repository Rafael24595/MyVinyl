 			<p class="title1">My Heart Cries for You</p>
 			<br>
			<p>If you're in Arizona, I'll follow you</p>
			<p>If you're in Minnesota, I'll be there too</p>
			<p>You'll have a million chances to start anew</p>
			<p>Because my love is endless for you</p>
			<p>My heart cries for you</p>
			<p>Sighs for you, dies for you</p>
			<p>And my arms long for you</p>
			<p>Please come back to me</p>
			<p>An unimportant quarrel was what we had</p>
			<p>We have to learn to live with the good and bad</p>
			<p>Together we were happy, apart we're sad</p>
			<p>This loneliness is driving me mad</p>
			<p>My heart cries for you</p>
			<p>Sighs for you, dies for you</p>
			<p>And my arms long for you</p>
			<p>Please come back to me</p>
			<p>Please come back to me</p>
			<p>Please come back, come back, come back to me</p>
