 			<p class="title1">He's a Tramp</p>
 			<br>
			<p>What a dog</p>
			<p>What a dog</p>
			<p>He's a tramp, but I love him</p>
			<p>Breaks a new heart every day</p>
			<p>He's a tramp, they adore him</p>
			<p>And I only hope he'll stay that way</p>
			<p>He's a tramp, he's a scoundrel</p>
			<p>He's a rounder, he's a cad</p>
			<p>He's a tramp, but I love him</p>
			<p>Yes, even I have got it pretty bad</p>
			<p>You can never tell when he'll show up</p>
			<p>He gives you plenty of trouble</p>
			<p>I guess he's just a no 'count pup</p>
			<p>But I wish that he were double</p>
			<p>He's a tramp, he's a rover</p>
			<p>And there's nothing more to say</p>
			<p>If he's a tramp, he's a good one</p>
			<p>And I wish that I could travel his way</p>
			<p>Wish that I could travel his way</p>
			<p>Wish that I could travel his way</p>
