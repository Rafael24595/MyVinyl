 			<br>
			<p>Though you've decided that our love is wrong</p>
			<p>And think that we should part</p>
			<p>It seems as though I have loved you so long</p>
			<p>You'll always be in my heart</p>
			<p>Is it a sin</p>
			<p>Is it a crime</p>
			<p>Loving you dear like I do</p>
			<p>If it's a crime then I'm guilty</p>
			<p>Guilty of loving you</p>
			<p>Maybe I'm wrong dreaming of you</p>
			<p>Dreaming the lonely night through</p>
			<p>If it's a crime then I'm guilty</p>
			<p>Guilty of dreaming of you</p>
			<p>What can I do</p>
			<p>What can I say</p>
			<p>After I've taken the blame?</p>
			<p>You say we're through</p>
			<p>You'll go your way</p>
			<p>But I'll always feel just the same</p>
			<p>Maybe I'm right</p>
			<p>Maybe I'm wrong</p>
			<p>Loving you dear like I do</p>
			<p>If it's a crime then I'm guilty</p>
			<p>Guilty of loving you</p>
